# MyAnime
A rather simple web scraping program for MyAnimeList




MyRandomAnime object takes one argument which is a string version of a nickname of a person's MAL account

As of now, the following methods are available:


.title_score(title = '') – if no argument is given, returns a dictionary of pairs Anime title and Score, otherwise returns a specified title and its score

.random_title(titles) – takes .title_score() as an argument to return a random Anime Title
